## ⏱️ Time Complexity

**O(n)**

* The array is traversed **once**
* One loop over `n` elements
* Each iteration does **constant-time operations**

  * subtraction
  * comparison
  * assignment

**No nested loops → linear time**

## 💾 Space Complexity

**O(1)**

* Uses a **constant number of variables**:

  * `minBuy`
  * `maxProfit`
  * `price`
* No additional data structures
* Memory usage does **not depend on input size**

**Input array is not counted in space complexity**
